    "# Creating a Cognite Function from a folder and scheduling it\n",
    "\n",
    "In certain situations it will be convenient to separate the functionality of a task into multiple python modules or files. In this example, we create a function from a folder containing these modules. We also look at how we can schedule our Cognite Function to run at regular intervals. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "We will be using the [experimental Cognite SDK](https://cognite-sdk-experimental.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/cognite.html#functions). \n",
    "To run this example, you first need to install this package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install cognite-sdk-experimental\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to connect to CDF we will authenticate using Azure AD. There are several ways to do this, all of them outlined in the [Authenticate with Azure AD](https://docs.cognite.com/dev/guides/sdk/python/python_auth_oidc/) documentation. We will in this example use [**client credentials**](https://docs.cognite.com/dev/guides/sdk/python/python_auth_oidc/#authenticate-with-client-secret). There are pros and cons to each authentication method. Here we choose client-credentials due to little additional work needed to get up and running.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we need the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A `token_client_id` and a `token_client_secret`;\n",
    "2. a `token_url` (can be inferred from the Azure tenant-ID); and finally,\n",
    "3. a list of `token_scopes` (can usually be inferred from the CDF cluster). "
